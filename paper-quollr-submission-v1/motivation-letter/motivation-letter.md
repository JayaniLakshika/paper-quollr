Dear Professor Rob J Hyndman,
\bigskip

We are pleased to submit our article titled *“quollr: An R Package for Visualizing 2-D Models from Nonlinear Dimension Reductions in High-Dimensional Space”*. `quollr` provides an intuitive, reproducible framework for evaluating and comparing nonlinear dimension reduction (NLDR) embeddings, helping users assess how well low-dimensional representations preserve high-dimensional structures such as clusters and local geometry.

We believe that this work will be of significant interest to the readers of *The R Journal*, especially those who use or develop dimension reduction methods for data analysis, visualization, or teaching. `quollr` provides generally applicable tools that can assist researchers in evaluating the performance of NLDR methods across a variety of contexts. By offering clear and reproducible visualizations of how two-dimensional embeddings relate to true models in the original space, the package supports more informed use of techniques such as tSNE, and UMAP.

We feel that *The R Journal* provides the ideal platform to share this work with the broader R community. The package contributes to ongoing efforts to enhance transparency, understanding, and rigor in the use of dimension reduction methods, while remaining compatible with familiar R workflows. We hope that `quollr` will prove to be a valuable tool for both applied users and method developers, and we look forward to your feedback.
