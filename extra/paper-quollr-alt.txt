# Chunk label: model-limb --------------------
## Alt-text: A pair of linked 2D scatterplots (t-SNE layouts) show points representing high-dimensional observations, with point colour indicating the cluster assigned in the published paper. Each plot has an x- and y-axis on an arbitrary t-SNE scale (both roughly spanning a limited range around zero), and the same binwidth of 0.06 is used in the underlying model of local neighbourhood structure. Colours visually group points into distinct spatial clusters, with locally dense regions and gaps that suggest separation between clusters. The “best” model layout (identified by the authors) preserves local structure and differences between clusters more clearly than alternative layouts, avoiding over-fragmentation into many tiny pieces while still revealing fine-grained cluster boundaries.

Assumptions: The exact axis labels and numeric ranges are not provided; they are assumed to be generic t-SNE dimensions centered roughly around zero. The description assumes two separate but similarly structured scatterplots, one of which is the best model.

Checklist:
1. Identified chart type. YES  
2. Named axes and variables. YES  
3. Mentioned approximate ranges or scales (where meaningful). YES  
4. Described data mappings (e.g. colour/shape/size/facets). YES  
5. Described main patterns, trends, or clusters. YES  
6. Explicitly noted any assumptions. YES

## Caption (for reference): `r knitr::asis_output(if (knitr::is_html_output()) { "Figure \\@ref(fig:tsne-link-limb), \\@ref(fig:tsne-link-limb-best)"} else { "Figure \\@ref(fig:model-limb)"})` show how to examine the resulting models of the layouts overlaid on the data in high dimensions. Point color represents the cluster reported in the published paper. In each case the best model is produced using $\text{binwidth}=0.06$. A binwidth of $0.06$ is used because it is small enough to show local structure and differences between clusters, but large enough to avoid breaking the layout into too many small pieces that would make the plots hard to interpret. The plots in these figures are best understand using small steps.
