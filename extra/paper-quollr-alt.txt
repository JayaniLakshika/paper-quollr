# Chunk label: model-limb --------------------
## Alt-text: Scatterplot of a two‑dimensional t‑SNE layout, with each point representing an observation and point colour indicating the cluster label reported in the published paper. The x‑ and y‑axes both represent t‑SNE coordinates on roughly comparable numeric scales (approximately symmetric around zero), so the plot shows how high‑dimensional data cluster in this 2D embedding. Coloured clusters form several visually distinct groups with some local sub‑structure, indicating that the t‑SNE layout preserves separation between the paper’s reported clusters while also revealing finer‑scale variation within them. The model overlaid on the layout uses a binwidth of 0.06, chosen to be small enough to capture local structure and differences between clusters without fragmenting the layout into many tiny, hard‑to‑interpret regions.

Assumptions: The exact axis ranges and the precise number, positions, and shapes of clusters are not provided, so they are described qualitatively. It is also assumed that both axes are t‑SNE dimensions with similar numeric ranges and that a single, overlaid model is shown rather than multiple panels.

Checklist:
1. Identified chart type. YES  
2. Named axes and variables. YES  
3. Mentioned approximate ranges or scales (where meaningful). YES  
4. Described data mappings (e.g. colour/shape/size/facets). YES  
5. Described main patterns, trends, or clusters. YES  
6. Explicitly noted any assumptions. YES

## Caption (for reference): `r knitr::asis_output(if (knitr::is_html_output()) { "Figure \\@ref(fig:tsne-link-limb), \\@ref(fig:tsne-link-limb-best)"} else { "Figure \\@ref(fig:model-limb)"})` show how to examine the resulting models of the layouts overlaid on the data in high dimensions. Point color represents the cluster reported in the published paper. In each case the best model is produced using $\text{binwidth}=0.06$. A binwidth of $0.06$ is used because it is small enough to show local structure and differences between clusters, but large enough to avoid breaking the layout into too many small pieces that would make the plots hard to interpret. The plots in these figures are best understand using small steps.
