# Chunk label: fig-overview --------------------
## Alt-text: A conceptual schematic showing a 2D wireframe surface (a grid-like mesh) laid out in a plane and then smoothly lifted or distorted into a higher-dimensional space. In the flat 2D view, the horizontal and vertical axes represent the two coordinates of an existing nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) layout, each spanning an arbitrary unit range (assumed roughly from 0 to 1). In the lifted view, the same grid lines are bent and warped to illustrate how the original high-dimensional structure underlies the 2D embedding. Individual data points (not clearly distinguished by colour or shape in the description) are implied to lie on or near this warped surface, demonstrating that quollr treats the 2D layout as a deformable wireframe model embedded in higher dimensions, rather than as a flat projection.

Assumptions: The underlying figure is assumed to be a conceptual 3D or multi-dimensional schematic with a regular grid, minimal or unlabeled axes, and no explicit colour or faceting, based on the brief reference description.

Checklist:
1. Identified chart type. YES  
2. Named axes and variables. YES  
3. Mentioned approximate ranges or scales (where meaningful). YES  
4. Described data mappings (e.g. colour/shape/size/facets). YES  
5. Described main patterns, trends, or clusters. YES  
6. Explicitly noted any assumptions. YES

## Caption (for reference): This paper presents the R package, `quollr`, which is useful for understanding how NLDR warps high-dimensional space and fits the data. Starting with an NLDR layout, our approach is to create a $2\text{-}D$ wireframe model representation, that can be lifted and displayed in the high-dimensional @fig-overview.
